# I am using nodemon coz i am a dev and anytime i would need to debug anything that goes bad with parcel dev server, and the best way to debug is to jump in to live executing code servers.
# Also another benefit of using nodemon is anytime you add/remove a .html file from the directory you are running run_parcel binary, you just need to type ``rs`` to restart the server with updated files.
# I am watching file `run_parcel` file so that if i make changes to `run_parcel` script, the already running script will simply reexecute so that new changes would take effect right away.

echo Tip: Use \`rs\` to manually restart the parcel dev server when you add/remove html/css/js files ü•ùÔ∏éü•ùÔ∏é.
