sudo systemctl stop code-server@array
sudo systemctl start/stop/restart/disable/enable code-server@array

Also the password for the code-server is saved @ same file too i.e., 

I replied on chaging the default port used when we use systemctl to start or restart code-server to use different port than 8082 by: `~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`

```txt
I found the default config for starting the code-server starting which works for systemctl is at path ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml and we can change line in it there like that below:

bind-addr: 127.0.0.1:8082
auth: password
password: 9de9bb96df2c98d1a7074879
cert: false
So as you can see I modified the port number in line 1 from 8080 (default) to 8082 so now when system boots up it'll use that port number.

Also you can use below command to start using new port number right away: sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER as well.
