# Learn code-server

```bash
sudo systemctl stop code-server@array
sudo systemctl start/stop/restart/disable/enable code-server@array
```

Also the password for the `code-server` is saved @ same file too i.e., 

I replied on chaging the default port used when we use systemctl to start or restart code-server to use different port than 8082 by: `~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`

```yaml
# File: ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
bind-addr: 127.0.0.1:8083
# bind-addr: 192.168.18.3:8083			# USE THIS TO SHARE OVER NETWORK.
auth: password
password: YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
cert: false
```

**Also you can use below command to start using new port number right away: sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER as well.**
