# LEARN: 1. Running a function from .bashrc file - You must keep the function definition
# before the return startement for non-interactive (Sub Shell) shell check because the

# LEARN: 2. We need to use source so that our functions are accessible.
# FOR NOW I AM RUNNING THIS CRON EVERY 2 HOURS TO BACKUP MY CONFIGURATION
